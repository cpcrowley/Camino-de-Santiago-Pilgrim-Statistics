******* To add a new months data *******
1. Change shared.js: montheForYear, add month, or a new year
2. Run: node lib/fetchPilgrimData.js
   Note: this will not refetch data we have already fetched, only the new month.
   If you want it to refetch data, delete files from /data.raw
3. Run: node lib/combineYears.js
   Note: this creates a new "./data/pData.json" which the web app reads.
4. Change the title for the current year in months: recomputePane.js line: 114
